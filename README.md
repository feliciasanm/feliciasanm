# Hi, I'm feliciasanm! 😃

I'm a coder and analyst who mostly do data science 📈 things nowadays, but I used to do light web 🌐 developments back in the days. I love creative problem-solving, and coding is a nice way to do that[^1] and build something at the same time.

I backup my code[^2] and showcase some of my portfolios here, and **these are some highlight projects I have on this Github:**

- I did a project [**analyzing coffee shop dataset**](https://github.com/feliciasanm/coffee-shop-dataset-analysis) and unearthing insights using Python and EDA ☕
- I [**predicted non-performing loans**](https://github.com/feliciasanm/machine-learning-npl) using logistic regression and ML techniques 💸
- I [**grouped 16,000+ books**](https://github.com/feliciasanm/nlp-book-summary) automatically using NLP techniques 📚
- I made an [**over-engineered 🤣 ETL pipeline**](https://github.com/feliciasanm/bitcoin-price-etl) with Airflow
- [Two](https://github.com/feliciasanm/data-analytics-order-brushing) [repos](https://github.com/feliciasanm/data-analytics-logistics-performance) of my **solution code for Shopee Code League 2020** (they're fun![^3])
- I once wrote a highly-minimalist, [**distraction-free writer**](https://github.com/feliciasanm/writer.html) in high school just because :)

Enjoy your visit here!

[^1]: Fun fact ⚡: I also do sudoku!
[^2]: The repos I backup up to Github are the ones proven to survive my hard drive's early demise twice 😆
[^3]: You might want to learn [R data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) first though 🙃
